## Legal Considerations

Web scraping can be a legal gray area, and it's important to understand the implications. While scraping for personal use may be permissible, hosting the web scraping code could potentially result in consequences, such as having your account banned. Ensure that you comply with the terms of service of the websites you scrape and respect their policies regarding data usage.
